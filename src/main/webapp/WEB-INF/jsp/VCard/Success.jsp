        Online address book typically enables users to create their own web page (or profile page) which is then indexed
        by search engines like Google and Yahoo. This in turn enables users to be found by other people via a search
        of their name and then contacted via their web page containing their personal information.
        Ability to find people registered with online address books via search engine searches usually varies
        according to the commonness of the name and the amount of results for the name.
